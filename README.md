# Hi there! ![Wave](https://github.com/hristomanos/hristomanos/blob/main/wave.gif)
### MSc Computer Games Programming graduate
I am a passionate games programmer who has been studying about and developing games for the past five years. When I was an undergraduate, I worked as a junior Unity 
developer during my placement year. I enjoyed discussing with game designers about game 
mechanics. I would then proceed to find solutions by designing and implementing the systems 
used for player character controls and artificial intelligence, aspects of game development that 
affect most of the gameplay experience. Furthermore, experimenting with low level graphics 
APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL gave me an insight on how the technological advances 
made in computer graphics can dramatically change the visual fidelity of interactive software. 
However, low level programming was not as rewarding as developing game mechanics 
that could be quickly shown to other people when playtesting. Therefore, my current aspirations are roles that 
include gameplay and AI programming.
